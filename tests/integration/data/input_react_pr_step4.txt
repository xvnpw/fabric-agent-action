-## User can run `fabric` withing Github issues
+## User can run `fabric` within GitHub issues

 As a GitHub user, I want to be able to use a GitHub action to leverage a large language model (LLM) from the [fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) app to perform various actions on GitHub issues, so that I can automate and streamline my workflow.

 **Acceptance Criteria**

-
-
-1. The GitHub action should be able to detect when a user adds a comment to a GitHub issue that starts with the keyword "fabric".
-2. The action should be able to parse the rest of the comment to determine the specific action the user wants to perform, such as "create stride threat model????
-3. The action should then pass the relevant information from the issue (e.g., the issue body in Markdown format) to the `fabric`, which will process the request and generate the appropriate output...
-4. The action should then post the output as a new comment on the original GitHub issue.
+1. The GitHub action should detect when a user adds a comment to a GitHub issue that starts with the keyword "fabric."
+2. The action should parse the rest of the comment to determine the specific action the user wants to perform, such as "create stride threat model."
+3. The action should then pass the relevant information from the issue (e.g., the issue body in Markdown format) to `fabric`, which will process the request and generate the appropriate output.
+4. The action should post the output as a new comment on the original GitHub issue.
 5. The action should handle any errors or failures gracefully, providing the user with a clear indication of what went wrong.

-## User can run fabric` with references to additional files in repository
+## User can run `fabric` with references to additional files in the repository

-As a GitHub user, I want the GitHub action to be able to fetch additional files from the repository, along with the issue information, so that I can provide the fabric with a more comprehensive set of data to process my requests.

 **Acceptance Criteria:**

-1. The GitHub action should be able to detect when a user adds a comment to a GitHub issue that starts with the keyword "fabric" and includes a request to fetch additional files.
-2. The action should be able to parse the comment to determine the specific files the user wants to fetch, in addition to the action they want to perform (e.g., "fabric, create stride threat model from this issue and the threat_model.md file").
-3. The action should then use the GitHub API to fetch the specified files from the repository.
-4. The action should combine the issue information (e.g., the issue body in Markdown format) and the fetched files, and pass this data to the fabric for processing.
-5. The action should then post the output from the fabric as a new comment on the original GitHub issue.

 6. The action should handle any errors or failures gracefully, providing the user with a clear indication of what went wrong (e.g., if a requested file does not exist).

 ## User can edit issue and re-run `fabric`

-As a GitHub user, I want to be able to edit the content of a GitHub issue after the initial fabric processing has been performed, and then ask the GitHub action to re-run the fabric processing on the updated issue, so that I can refine my request and get updated results.

-3. If the user has edited the issue content since the last fabric processing, the action should use the updated issue content and any previously fetched files for the re-processing.
-4. The action should post the new output from the fabric as a new comment on the original GitHub issue.
-5. The action should handle any errors or failures gracefully, providing the user with a clear indication of what went wrong (e.g., if the fabric returns an error).

 ## User can run chained `fabric` calls

-As a GitHub user, I want to be able to submit a series of fabric requests that can be executed in sequence, so that I can perform more complex workflows or multi-step processes on the GitHub issue content.

-# AI Nutrition-Pro
-
-## Business background
-
-Dietitians use online applications to create meals, diets and calculate calories called meal planners. Different professionals have different ways of creating diets, which gives a personal style to it. LLMs can reproduce this personal style of writing based on samples of already created content. Meal planners can use LLMs to speed up diet creation for dietitians.
-
-## Project Overview
-
-AI Nutrition-Pro will be backend API application that will have the possibility to integrate with any meal planner application for dietitians. It will reproduce the personal style of a nutrition specialist based on samples.
-
-
-
-Dietitians will not use the application directly but from their meal planner applications. There will be no user interface exposed to Dietitians. Integration will be using meal plan applications backend.
-
-Direct clients of AI Nutrition-Pro will be applications like DietMaster Pro, Nutritionist Pro, or others. Those clients will send to AI Nutrition-Pro samples of content and AI Nutrition-Pro will generate requested type of content based on that. AI Nutrition-Pro will use LLM to generate requested content.
-
-## Core Features
-
-- multi  tenant API application - where tenant is client application like DietMaster Pro, Nutritionist Pro, or others.
-- each tenant can contain many dietitians.
-- each dietitian can have multiple customers...
-- the application will be deployed into AWS cloud and use cloud-based services to store and process data.
-- the application will store and process PII information that might contain personal health data of customers.
